# pfodParser
The pfodParser library is handles commands sent from the Android pfodApp, pfodApp supports WiFi, BLE, Bluetooth and SMS connections, the library also includes support for sending dwg commands back to pfodApp to create interactive GUI's.

This library includes:-  
* **pfodParser**, parses pfodApp commands  
* **pfodSecurity**, alternative to pfodParser that adds 128bit sercuity   
* **pfodDwgs**, classes for sending dwg commands to create interactive GUI's
